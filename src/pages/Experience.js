          I have accumulated experiences by doing project assignment and also
          personal projects that help me improve as a developer. <br />
          Here are a few of my projects that i've done:
        </p>
        <ul class="experience">
          <li>
            <a href="">Calculator</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Experience;
